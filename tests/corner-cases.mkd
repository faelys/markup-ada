# Indentation

No indentation yields a normal paragraph.

 One space indentation also yields a normal paragraph.

   Three-space indentation is on the edge but still a normal paragraph.

    Four-space indentation switches to code block.

	One-tab indentation is also a code block.

Following is an invalid HTML comment that is still accepted as such by
the parser.
